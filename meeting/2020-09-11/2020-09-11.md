## Previous Questions and Plan

what the loss represents

*formula*

reconstruction_loss = MSE(reconstructed_image, image)
compression and inference loss = weight_coef  *  KL Divergence(latent, unit_gaussian)

## 1. Two stage infoMaxVAE [finished]

**Objective function:**



**Flow chart**: 

Training process is very unstable unstable:

**VAE2** low fidelity reconstruction collapsed:

## 3. Meeting with John on Tuesday

1. Measure the MSE loss (recon) of individual channels between reconstructed and images.
2. 

## 4. The human guidance [VAE 2]

Having trouble understanding some of the programming details.



## Plan 

- Compare ***Explanation by progressive exaggeration ICLR 2020*** with 77 pages paper 
- Fix the 
- Upload
