In previous meeting, we have shown the mean average ensembles of the augmented data. We applied an additional linear layer to weight each 

When testing, we use the connectivity matrices deduced from complete ROI signals.  **should keep same**

## **Spatial Temporal GNN** 

Implementing ST-GCN and attention mechanism on the node weightings. Estimated to be finished within two weeks.

## **Plan for T3**

- Report and Notebook: mark the progress, what algorithms we have implemented, summary of each methods.

  each of project us need to provide a team report. 

- Catch up with faculty, demonstration for competition

   

- Deliverables for VIP

  - What is being marked?
  - 3D map plot highlighting discriminative biomarkers that contributes to AD
  - demonstration by week 8
  - when is our report due? week ?
  - week 4 - 5 to prepare for the demo

# meeting notes

for testing use the augmented data
